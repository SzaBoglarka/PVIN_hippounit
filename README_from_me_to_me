This hippounit version - using standard features was cloned from: 

https://github.com/blazma/hippounit/tree/master/hippounit/tests
 and the Somatest_with_standard_features has been furher developed by me. 

This new version have to be uploaded to github, by forking the original standard version, and 
updating it with the new changes. 
(new frequency-based standard current definitions)

The same has to be done with the standard bluephyefe version, that was based on: 
https://github.com/blazma/BluePyEfe
and is extended with the handling of baseline currents (also called holding currents), new frequency-based standard current definitions,
 and bad trace measurements. 


Additional considerations: 

It would be nice, it this hippounit version could apply holding current in the stimulation 
and b that set the baseline of the models to a given voltage. 
This shouldn"t be too difficult to implement, but would be a nice add-on.
